OmEngine static library. December, 2017.

Om_engine library consist of several descending dependent modules:

                        1. Widgets
             -----------------------------------
            |                                   |
        2. Animation                3. Geometry modification

It is mean that more lower module is not depend from upper and
you can use it separately.

                        1. WIDGETS

It is simple set of widgets, inherited from of Qt library classes and
modified a little.
Also it include more lower modules of OmEngine library for correct
animation and widget composing or scaling.

List of OmEngine library widgets:

1. ClickButton:
it is a QPushButton but it may offset(or not) when cursor is entry of button
space. You can configure the side of offset and the size of offset.

2. Time and Date:
widgets, inherited from QLabel and implement only one thing - demonstration
of time or date after those initialization. It is mean, once you define this
widgets - they'll be change time and date.


                        2. ANIMATION
- fill the description, tell about action when widget open/closed from
constructor, and what to do for perfom animation properly

- tell about WidgetConditionAnimator, how to use, about ctors of this class
