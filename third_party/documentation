OmEngine static library. December, 2017.

Om_engine library consist of several descending dependent modules:

1. Widgets
2. Animation
3. Composing
4. Basic

It is mean that more lower module is not depend from upper and you can use it separately.

Lets consider the upper module - Widgets

It is simple set of widgets, inherited from of Qt library classes and modified a little.
Also it include more lower modules of OmEngine library for correct animation and widget
composing or scaling.


2. Animation -
fill the description, tell about action when widget open/closed from constructor,
and what to do for perfom animation properly
