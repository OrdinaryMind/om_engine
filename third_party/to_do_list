+ 1.    Initiate repo
+ 2.    Create OmButton
+ 3.    Add variable for widget animation state determination:
        3.1 Is widget closed?
        3.2 Is widget opened?
        Exclude repeated animation of opening/closing (static variable?)
+ 4.    Refactor WidgetAnimator and AnimationGeometrySetter
+ 5.    Perform multiple widget animation test in separate class
+ 6.    Add text animation (aka running string)
        6.1 Develop api of text animation class:
        6.1.1 Maybe need some boolean methods for animated/not animated
        text state, like:
        bool IsTextAnimated() const;
        6.2 Embrace text animator in namespace
+ 7.    How to make animation properly while widget is closed?
+ 8.    Remove non-forward declaration includes in headers
+ 9.    Develop time and date classes
- 10.   Develop GeometryComposer class
- 11.   Notify users about C++11/14 standard usage
+ 12.   Run GeometryComposer, modify is needed
- 13.   Add scaling transformation type to GeometryComposer
- 14.   Develop base class for all widgets in OmEngine
- 15.   Compose all existing widgets via GeometryController
- 16.   Solve problem related with animation and composing
