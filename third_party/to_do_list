+ 1. Initiate repo
+ 2. Create OmButton
+ 3. Add variable for widget animation state determination:
    3.1 Is widget closed?
    3.2 Is widget opened?
    Exclude repeated animation of opening/closing (static variable?)
+ 4. Refactor WidgetAnimator and AnimationGeometrySetter
+ 5. Perform multiple widget animation test in separate class
- 6. Add text animation (aka running string)
    6.1 Develop api of text animation class:
    6.1.1 Add opportunity animate text from simple method and public slot
    6.1.2 Maybe need some boolean methods for animated/not animated
    text state, like:
    bool IsTextAnimated() const;
