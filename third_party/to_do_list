R - removed
+ - done
- - not ready

+ 1.    Initiate repo

+ 2.    Create OmButton

+ 3.    Add variable for widget animation state determination:
        3.1 Is widget closed?
        3.2 Is widget opened?
        Exclude repeated animation of opening/closing (static variable?)

+ 4.    Refactor WidgetAnimator and AnimationGeometrySetter

+ 5.    Perform multiple widget animation test in separate class

+ 6.    Add text animation (aka running string)
        6.1 Develop api of text animation class:
        6.1.1 Maybe need some boolean methods for animated/not animated
        text state, like:
        bool IsTextAnimated() const;
        6.2 Embrace text animator in namespace

+ 7.    How to make animation properly while widget is closed?

+ 8.    Remove non-forward declaration includes in headers

+ 9.    Develop time and date classes

R 10.   Develop GeometryComposer class

- 11.   Notify users about C++11/14 standard usage

+ 12.   Run GeometryComposer, modify is needed

R 13.   Add scaling transformation type to GeometryComposer

+ 14.   Develop base class for all widgets in OmEngine

R 15.   Compose all existing widgets via GeometryController

+ 16.   Solve problem related with animation and composing

+ 17.   Remade all composers, or re-develop them again
        1) using abstract factory pattern
        2) add methods as set modification factors for
        further usage

        Decision: refuse from factory idea, use scaler class

+ 18.   Merge two method in ClickButton
        1) SetOffsetSide
        2) SetOffsetDistance
        into one SetOffsetParameters(side, distance_px)

+ 19.   Prepare scaler and animator for including in base frame class:
        - ensure all constructors availability

- 20.   Include FontSizeGenerator library into OmEngine

- 21.   Add set of animation blocks for any Qt widgets
